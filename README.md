# Rental Car Management System using Java

I have developed a rental car management system using Java programming language.
The system allows users to book and check the availability of vehicles for rent.

To keep track of rented cars, I utilized a hashtable data structure. Additionally, 
another hashtable data structure was implemented to keep track of vehicles rented 
by a specific owner.

To ensure the proper functioning of the application, I implemented a unit testing 
mechanism using JUnit. This testing mechanism verifies that the application runs 
according to the specified specifications, ensuring a seamless user experience.
